        Our Path to Becoming a Trillion Dollar Stablecoin

        <p>
          Let's start with why. To say it simply, the world
          needs an alternative to inflation-ridden fiat currencies. Every year, fiat erodes the savings of hard-working
          families, and every year, governments continue to accumulate unsustainable debts that threaten to collapse our
          entire system. Regardless of how long the current system lasts, it cannot go on forever. We need something better.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crypto has gained major momentum over the last fifteen years, and yet, it hasn't ushered in a new medium of exchange.
          Bitcoin is still used in less than 0.000% of the world's marketplace transactions, and
          Tether isn't so much a new currency as it is just a digital form of the dollar (albeit, a riskier one).
        </p>

        <p>
          It's unsurprising that no new medium of exchange has emerged. Bootstrapping a new unit of money is incredibly
          difficult. This is especially true when the market is dominated by a single reserve currency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost everyone
          has a dollar, and so, naturally, almost everyone uses it. According to the Bank for International Settlements,
          between 88-90% of all financial transactions globally use the dollar on at least one side of the trade. Even in
          the crypto space, the dollar reigns supreme &ndash; over 99% of all stablecoins are pegged to the dollar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Argon is fundamentally different from other stablecoins. It isn't pegged to the dollar. It's a new unit of
          currency that is independently pegged to an inflation index, and even more, it holds zero assets that are tied
          to the dollar or any part of the world's banking system. This means, if the dollar disappeared tomorrow, Argon
          will remain stable. Even if the entire banking system collapsed, Argon will not be affected.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, Argon's independence as a currency does not alleviate its go-to-market challenge, which is that, everyone
          already uses the dollar. Why would the first argon user acquire argons to use as payment if no one is accepting
          argon? It's the classic chicken and egg problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Non-dollar fiat currencies avoid this chicken and egg problem. Unlike Argon, fiat
          currencies are controlled by countries who dictate usage within their borders. This creates
          an instant two-sided market. It's why they call it "fiat", which means "decree by force." Citizens are forced
          to use their nation's currency, at the very least, to pay taxes. In contrast, Argon has no ability to force usage.
          Our only option is to entice, and to do that, we must side step the chicken and egg.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of attempting to bootstrap a two-sided currency market out of nothing, Argon will begin
          by focusing almost exclusively on non-currency functions. By this, we mean, Argon will be used to price-hedge Bitcoin.
          Argon's novel stabilization mechanism gives bitcoin-holders the ability to hedge their assets against downside
          volatility, and it works regardless of network size (i.e., the first user finds just as much value as the one millionth).
          This is a huge value-add for the bitcoin market, and in doing so, it converts Bitcoin's fixed 21M
          supply into an elastic yet stable Argon currency. You can
          <router-link to="/learn-more">read more about this in our whitepapers</router-link>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Argon's incentive structure for Bitcoin price-hedging creates an exponential growth curve of stablecoin minting
          that escalates until Argon's circulation becomes twice the size of Bitcoin's market value. At that
          scale, Argon will have the critical mass required to begin operating as an independent, global
          currency (i.e., enough people will hold argon). See our soon to be released, <RouterLink to="/learn-more">third whitepaper</RouterLink>.

          Okay, so obviously the title of this page is misleading. Our plan isn't a secret. We're publishing it for the world to read. Nevertheless,
          our approach is both contrarian and unorthodox. This is especially true in the way we're launching Argon's genesis block...

              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase One is to create enough tokens to bootstrap the network into existence without
                awarding tokens to premediated individuals.
              </div>
              <p>
                Unlike almost all other crypto projects, Argon is offering no pre-mined favoritism
                to its founders or early adopters. On January 15, 2025, Argon will launch with zero rewards in its genesis block.
                To ensure a fair distribution, it's introducing a two-step proof-of-work process that employs two different consensus mechanisms,
                in order to give everyone an equal chance to earn early rewards.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-bold mt-2 -mb-3">Proof-of-Compute-Work</h3>
              <p>
                Beginning on January 15, 2025, anyone can connect their laptop, desktop, or even rented cloud servers
                to begin mining tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, Argon's proof-of-work algorithm does not favor special mining hardware.
                It employs a custom, ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm designed to keep mining
                accessible and competitive.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-bold mt-2 -mb-3">Proof-of-Authorized-Work</h3>
              <p>
                Once ~10,000 argons are minted into existence, Argon will transition into its second phase-one launch step.
                From this point forward, active miners will be determined through auctions. Participants are required to bid
                argons for the right to secure a mining seat. Winners are selected based on highest bid. The winning mining seats
                are allowed to mine for a set duration of ten frames (equivalent to ten 24-hour days). This system creates
                a transparent, market-based method for allocating mining power.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-bold mt-2 -mb-3">Why This Matters</h3>
              <p>
                Argon's two-step launch solves a critical economic challenge: with no founder tokens in the genesis block, it
                is impossible for anyone to bid for mining seats on day one (i.e., there would be no argons to bid with).
                Proof-of-Compute-Work allows the network to mint the initial argons organically, which then allows
                Proof-of-Authorized-Work to take over.

            <div Content>
              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Two is to simplify Argon's decentralized architecture so that anyone, even non-technically-minded
                individuals, can participate in the management and operations of Argon.
              </div>

              <p>
                The majority of this phase will be focused on designing and building our desktop app (Argon Investor
                Console) that allows non-technical investors to directly run mining and vaulting nodes. It will have
                no centralized backend or account management that depends on third-party services. This will ensure it
                can run in a decentralized fashion with no gatekeepers to track or control user operations.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition, the following items will also be addressed in this phase:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-5 font-light space-y-3">
                <li>
                  Redesign the mining seat auctions to create better transparency and liquidity. The auction process
                  implemented in Phase One created too much capital inefficiency, which in turn created unhealthy
                  competition among the miners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a Network Treasury to pre-fund bitcoin liquidity even if Argon's price is below target. This solves the
                  last remaining black swan event identified in our 2nd whitepaper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improve the distribution of mining rights and block rewards in order to make mining and vaulting profits more predictable.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This phase is solely focused on internal improvement, but we believe it's critical to Argon's long-term success.
                It will help create a more efficient, balanced, and open network, which will provide a stronger foundation for the next stage
                of Argon's growth.

            <div Content>
              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Three is to build a growing community of backend miners and vaulters who can help us
                bootstrap the circulation of Argon stablecoins from one million to hundreds of millions.
              </div>

              <p>
                This phase marks the critical inflection point where we will begin scaling Argon into a major stablecoin. It also
                coincides with the first launch of Argon Investor Console, our desktop app designed for Windows, Linux, and macOS
                users.
              </p>

              <p>
                No efforts will be made during this phase to recruit general users into the Argon ecosystem or even to
                encourage typical stablecoin usage. Instead, we will focus on building a broad community of miners and
                vaulters. Our goal is to end this phase with an Argon's circulation of around 200-300 million. This will
                provide an economic mass large enough to support meaningful market activity without unhealthy price volatility.
              </p>

              <p><strong class="font-bold">We're looking for three roles</strong>, hopefully with a lot of cross-over between them:</p>

              <ul class="font-light">
                <li class="list-['-'] ml-3 pl-3">
                  <strong class="font-bold">Argon Miners</strong>. These are individuals with an extra desktop, laptop, or cloud
                  machine they can dedicate to Argon mining. Little technical experience is required, but the compute
                  resources must be available 24/7. Miners will collectively earn the minting rewards of the 200M-300M
                  argons that we expect to be minted during this phase. An initial amount of argons/argonots are required
                  to secure the initial mining seats desired.
                </li>

                <li class="list-['-'] ml-3 pl-3 mt-5">
                  <strong class="font-bold">Argon Vaulters</strong>. These are individuals with an extra desktop or laptop who are
                  able to spend a few minutes every couple days to manage bitcoin locking/unlocking. Very little
                  technical or crypto experience is required. Vaulters collectively earn the auction
                  bidding fees paid by mining seats. Their primary role is to help stabilize the growing circulation of
                  argons being produced by the miners.
                </li>

                <li class="list-['-'] ml-3 pl-3 mt-5">
                  <strong class="font-bold">Bitcoin Owners</strong>. Individuals who own bitcoins or
                  fractions of bitcoins and want to hedge their downside risk in case bitcoin's price falls. By locking
                  their bitcoins, they help stabilize Argon while gaining the ability to unlock the full market value of
                  their locked bitcoin.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We hope to have around a thousand individuals participating by the end of Phase Three. They will be spread
                among mining, vaulting and bitcoin liquid-locking. Together they will form the foundation of
                Argon's economic engine as we move into Phase Four.

                without needing to run a mining node or manage a vault.
              </div>

              <p>
                We'll continue our efforts from Phase Three, working to build a robust community of miners and vaulters.
                In addition, we'll launch Argon Bankless, our desktop/mobile app for the broader consumer market.
              </p>

              <p>
                Argon Bankless will be a free, open-source, and decentralized app that makes it easy for anyone to get
                involved in the Argon ecosystem without needing to run mining or vaulting nodes. It will assist in
                managing argon/argonot assets, liquid-locking their bitcoins, and investing in the treasury funds of
                network vaults. It will also bring Argon's Localchain functionality into a simple point-click interface.
                Localchain is Argon's P2P payment network, which allows users to send and receive fast/free payments
                directly between devices. It also supports micro-payments between AI agents through MCP hooks.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although the Bankless app will facilitate p2p payment functionality, we expect Argon's primary focus
                will remain on Bitcoin price-hedging for the duration of this phase. One of the core properties of Bitcoin
                price-hedging is the argons used as securitization. This will consume most of the new argons being minted
                into circulation, at least for the first trillion in circulation.

              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Five is to ensure that as the network grows, the cost of seat auctions does not begin
                to aggregate power in the hands of a few at the expense of many.
              </div>

              <p>
                We expect this phase to primarily focus on internal improvements to Argon's mining structure. Because of
                Argon's seigniorage properties -- newly minted currency accrues to the issuers/miners -- as circulation
                grows, mining seats in the network become increasingly valuable. This risks pushing the cost to participate
                in mining out of reach for the average Joe/Jill.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, Argon's auctions are forever capped at 144 mining seats per day. If Argon's circulation grows
                by $1B in a given year (see Ethena, USDC, Tether, DAI, FDUSD, etc), the minimum cost for a single seat would
                easily surpass $19k. Similarly, if circulation grows by $100B in a given year, the minimum cost is $1.9M.
              </p>

              <p>
                The simple solution is to enable fractional ownership of mining seats. No single entity would be required
                to own an entire seat. Any collective group of entities could co-own and share in block rewards. This also
                has the benefit of creating fallback mining nodes in the case of a single server failing. Other
                co-miners would step in and provide redundancy, which ensures the collective never loses mining rewards.

              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Six is to open Argon's ability to delegate currency control to local Notaries,
                whether they be offgrid communities or sovereign nation states.
              </div>

              <p>
                One of the more fascinating properties of Argon's technical design is its p2p Localchain. It allows
                individuals to move argons into local networks that can settle transactions without requiring signoff from
                the broader network. This means an apocalyptic event, or simply an off-the-grid weekend trip with buddies,
                does not shutdown your ability to conduct commerce. These localchains can reconnect back to the mainchain
                at any point over the following months, years or even decades with no loss of value.
              </p>

              <p>
                Similarly, individuals can move their argons into nation-wide networks, which we're calling Sovereign Notaries.
                These Sovereign Notaries can implements their own governance rules, which opens up fascinating possibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, nation states can create Argon-derived
                local currencies that implement custom taxation, regulatory oversight, or other governance mechanisms specific
                to their jurisdiction. Regardless of the laws within each Sovereign Notary, Argon's mainchain
                and underlying Argon value will remain free and durable for a thousand years or longer.
