        <p>
          Let's start with why. To say it at its simplest, the world
          needs an alternative to inflation-ridden fiat currencies. Every year, fiat erodes the savings of hard-working
          families, and every year, governments continue to accumulate unsustainable debts that threaten to collapse the
          entire system. Regardless of how long the current system lasts, it cannot go on forever. We need something better.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crypto has gained major momentum over the last fifteen years, and yet, it hasn't ushered in a new medium of exchange.
          Bitcoin is still used in less than 0.000% of the world's marketplace transactions, and
          Tether isn't so much a new currency as it is just a digital form of the dollar (albeit, a riskier one). It's not surprising
          no new medium of exchange has emerged. Bootstrapping a new currency incredibly
          is difficult. This is especially true when the market is dominated by a single reserve currency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost everyone
          has a dollar, and so, naturally, almost everyone uses it. According to the Bank for International Settlements,
          between 88-90% of all financial transactions globally use the dollar on at least one side of the trade. Even in
          the crypto space, the dollar reigns supreme &ndash; over 99% of all stablecoins are pegged to the dollar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Argon is fundamentally different from other stablecoins. It isn't pegged to the dollar. It's a new unit of
          currency that is independently pegged to an inflation index, and even more, it holds zero assets that are tied
          to the dollar or any part of the world's banking system. This is a huge benefit over almost every other
          stablecoin, because if the dollar disappears tomorrow, the Argon would remain stable. Even if the entire
          banking system collapses, Argon will not be affected.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, Argon's independence as a currency does not alleviate its go-to-market challenge, which is that, everyone
          already uses the dollar. Why would the first argon users acquire argon if no one is accepting
          argon? It's the classic chicken and egg problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Non-dollar fiat currencies avoid this chicken and egg problem. Unlike Argon, fiat
          currencies are controlled by nation states who dictate official usage within their borders. This creates
          an instant two-sided market. It's why they call it "fiat", which means "decree by force." Citizens are forced
          to use their nation's currency, at the very least, to pay their taxes. In contrast, Argon has no ability to force usage.
          Our only option is to entice, and to do that, we must start with non-currency functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of attempting to bootstrap a two-sided currency market from nothing, Argon will begin
          by focusing almost exclusively on non-currency functions. By this, we mean, Bitcoin price-hedging. Argon's novel
          stabilization mechanism gives bitcoin-holders the ability to fully hedge their assets against downside
          volatility, and it has no need for network effects (the first user finds just as much value as the one millionth).
          This is a huge value-add for the bitcoin market, and in doing so, it converts Bitcoin's fixed 21M
          supply into an elastic yet stable currency. You can
          <router-link to="/learn-more">read more about this in our whitepapers</router-link>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's important to understand that Argon's incentive structure for Bitcoin
          price-hedging creates an exponential growth curve that continues escalating until Argon's stablecoin circulation
          becomes twice the size of Bitcoin's market value (we're working on a third whitepaper around this).
          At that scale of circulation, Argon have the critical mass required to begin operating as an independent, global currency.

          Okay, so obviously the title of this page is misleading. Our plan isn't a secret. We're publishing it for the world to read. Nevertheless,
          our approach is contrarian and definitely unorthodox. This is especially true in the way we're launching Argon's genesis block...

                The goal of Phase One is to create enough tokens to bootstrap the network and begin mining without
                awarding tokens to premediated individuals.
              </div>
              <p>
                Unlike most other crypto projects, Argon is offering no pre-mining favoritism
                to its founders or early adopters. On January 15, 2025, Argon will launch with zero rewards in its genesis block.
                To ensure a fair distribution, it's introducing a two-step proof-of-work process that employs two different consensus mechanisms,
                giving everyone an equal chance to earn early rewards.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-bold mt-2 -mb-3">Proof-of-Compute-Work</h3>
              <p>
                Beginning on January 15, 2025, anyone can connect their laptop, desktop, or even rented cloud servers
                to begin mining. Unlike Bitcoin, Argon's proof-of-work algorithm does not favor special mining hardware.
                Instead, it employs a custom, ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm designed to keep mining
                accessible and competitive.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-bold mt-2 -mb-3">Proof-of-Authorized-Work</h3>
              <p>
                Once ~10,000 argons are minted into existence, Argon will transition into its second phase-one launch step.
                From this point forward, active miners are determined through auctions. Participants were required to bid
                argons for the right to secure a mining seat. Winners are selected based on highest bid. The winning mining seats
                are allowed to mine for a set duration of ten frames (equivalent to ten 24-hour days). This system creates
                a transparent, market-based method for allocating mining power.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-bold mt-2 -mb-3">Why This Matters</h3>
              <p>
                Argon's two-step launch solves a critical economic challenge: with no founder tokens in the genesis block, it
                is impossible for anyone to bid for mining seats on day one. There would be no argons to bid with!
                Proof-of-Compute-Work allows the network to mint the initial argons organically, which then allows
                Proof-of-Authorized-Work to take over.

            <div Content>
              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Two is to simplify Argon's decentralized system so that anyone, even non-technically-minded
                individuals, can participate in the management and operations of Argon.
              </div>

              <p>
                The majority of this phase will be focused on designing and implementing a desktop app (Argon Investor Console) that allows non-technical
                investors to directly run mining and vaulting nodes. It will have no centralized backend or account management
                that depends on any third-party service. This will ensure its ability to run in a decentralized fashion with no
                gatekeepers or centralized control points, and no ability to track or interfere with user operations.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition, the following items will also be addressed in this phase:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-5 font-light space-y-3">
                <li>
                  Redesign the mining seat auction process to create better transparence and liquidity. The auction system
                  implemented in Phase One created too much capital inefficiency, which in turn created a large amount unhealthy
                  competition among the miners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a Network Treasury to pre-fund bitcoin liquidity even if Argon's price is below target. This solves the
                  last remaining black swan event identified in our 2nd whitepaper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improve the distribution of mining rights and block rewards in order to make mining and vaulting profits more predictable.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This phase is solely focused on internal improvement, but we believe it's critical to Argon's long-term success.
                It will help create a more efficient, balanced, and open network, which will provide a stronger foundation for the next stage
                of Argon's growth.

              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Three is to build a growing community of miners and vaulters who can help us bootstrap the circulation
                of Argon stablecoins from one million to hundreds of millions.
              </div>

              <p>
                This phase marks the critical inflection point where we begin scaling Argon into a major stablecoin. It also
                coincides with the launch of Argon Investor Console, a desktop app designed for Windows, Linux, and macOS
                users.
              </p>

              <p>
                No efforts will be made during this phase to recruit general users into the Argon ecosystem or even to
                encourage typical stablecoin usage. Instead, we will focus on building a broad community of miners and
                vaulters. Our goal is end this phase with an Argon's circulation of around
                200-300 million. This will provide an economic mass large enough to support meaningful market activity
                without unhealthy price volatility.
              </p>

              <p><strong class="font-bold">We're looking for three types of people</strong>, hopefully with a lot of cross-over between the buckets:</p>

              <ul class="font-light">

                  <strong class="font-bold">Argon Miners</strong>. These are individuals with an extra desktop, laptop, or cloud
                  machine they can dedicate to Argon mining. Little technical experience is required, but the compute
                  resources must be available 24/7. Miners will collectively earn the minting rewards of the 200M-300M
                  argons that we expect to be minted during this phase. An initial amount of argons/argonots are required
                  to secure the initial mining seats desired.
                </li>

                <li class="list-['-'] ml-3 pl-3 mt-5">
                  <strong class="font-bold">Argon Vaulters</strong>. These are individuals with an extra desktop or laptop who are
                  able to spend a few minutes every couple days to manage bitcoin locking/unlocking. Very little
                  technical or crypto experience is required. Vaulters collectively earn the auction
                  bidding fees paid by mining seats. Their primary role is to help stabilize the growing circulation of
                  argons being produced by the miners.
                </li>

                <li class="list-['-'] ml-3 pl-3 mt-5">
                  <strong class="font-bold">Bitcoin Owners</strong>. Individuals who own bitcoins or
                  fractions of bitcoins and want to hedge their downside risk in case bitcoin's price falls. By locking

                  their locked bitcoin.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We hope to have around a thousand individuals participating by the end of Phase Three. They will be spread
                among mining, vaulting and bitcoin liquid-locking. Together they will form the foundation of
                Argon's economic engine as we move into Phase Four.

                without needing to run a mining node or manage a vault.
              </div>

              <p>
                This phase continues our efforts from Phase Three to continue building a robust community of miners
                and vaulters. In addition, it coincides with the launch of Argon Bankless, our desktop/mobile app that will
                catapult us into a much broader consumer market. The app makes it easy for anyone to get involved in the
                Argon ecosystem without becoming a miner or vaulter.
              </p>

              <p>
                Argon Bankless will be a free, open-source, and decentralized app that allows anyone to manage their
                argon/argonot assets, liquid-lock their bitcoins, and invest in the treasury funds of network vaults. It
                will also bring Argon's Localchain functionality into a similar parity as Apply Pay. Locachain is Argon's
                P2P payment network, which allows users to send and receive fast/free payments directly between their devices.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although directly p2p payment functionality will begin wide-spread testing in this phase, we expect most
                of Argon's focus will remain on financial ecosystem of Bitcoin price-hedging. The argons required
                for Bitcoin price hedging will naturally consume most of the argons in circulation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Payment integrations for Argon Localchain will likely be a combination
                of AI payment integrations through MCP hooks, as well as more traditional crypto wallets and payment endpoints.

              </div>

              <p>
                We expect this phase to primarily focus on internal improvements to Argon's mining system. Because of the
                the seigniorage properties of Argon -- newly minted currency accrues to the issuers/miners -- mining seats
                in the network will become increasingly more valuable. This risks pushing the cost to participate
                in mining out of reach for average Joes.
              </p>

                Argon's auctions are forever capped at 144 mining seats per day. If Argon's circulation grows by just $1B
                over a given year (see Ethena, USDC, Tether, DAI, FDUSD, etc), the value of a single seat would surpass a
                minimum of $19k. Similarly, if circulation grows by $100B in a given year, a single seat would be $1.9M.
              </p>

              <p>
                The ideal solution is to enable fractional ownership of mining seats. Instead of a single entity owning the
                entire seat, a group of entities would be able to co-own the seat and share in the block rewards. This also
                has the benefit of creating fallback mining nodes in the case of a single server going down. Instead of a
                single seat losing out on rewards during their downtime, the other co-miners can step in and provide
                redundancy.

              <div Goal>
                The goal of Phase Six is to open Argon's ability to delegate currency control to local Notaries,
                whether they be offgrid communities or sovereign nation states.
              </div>

              <p>
                One of the more fascinating properties of Argon's technical design is its p2p Localchain. It allows
                individuals to move their argons into local Notaries that can survive and operate without the mainchain.
                This allows groups of individuals to continue transacting in the event of an apocalyptic scenario or simply
                during an off-the-grid weekend trip with buddies. These localchains can reconnect back to the mainchain
                at any point over the following months, years or even decades with no loss of value.
              </p>

              <p>
                Similarly, individuals can move their argons into nation-state Notaries, which we've termed Sovereign Notaries.
                Unlike the more temporary off-the-grid weekend Notaries, these Sovereign Notaries can implements their own
                governance rules, which opens up fascinating possibilities. For example, nation states can create Argon-derived
                local currencies that implement custom taxation, regulatory oversight, or other governance mechanisms specific
                to their jurisdiction. Regardless of the nation state's legal process or long-term viability, Argon's mainchain
                and underlying Argon value remain free and durable.
